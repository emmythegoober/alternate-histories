    <h2><br><br>His Night<br><br><br><br><br></h2>
    <p>It was blinding. <i>Everything</i> was just so blinding.</p><br>
    <p>After all those votes were tallied up, after all the chaos and destruction, and after it became clear that Donald Trump would become the Republican nominee, this night in Philadelphia would seal the deal. The popular vote showed his victory certain, but no one knew what the crazed super-delegates would do. Would they allow the Revolution to finally happen? Or would they keep the nation rotting, stuck in the past, agonizing in the bed of neoliberalism?</p><br>
    <p>The prelude to the DNC nomination ritual was anything but smooth sailing, he felt like he could fall at any moment, that any wrong step could be his demise. The backstage rooms of the Wells Fargo Center were damp and smelled terrible, but at this point, he was accustomed to it. He pleaded with every one of those crooked super-delegates to follow what the nation truly wanted. And somehow, they listened.</p><br>

    <p>He felt good. He felt really good hearing the numbers count up and nominate him as the Democrat's torchbearer. All these years in obscurity, all these years playing second fiddle to the neoliberals—no more! He would be just a forgotten senator no more! The unheard would be listened to! He would choose a true, principled running mate, and who else to grab than Klobuchar? It was blinding, everything was just so blinding.</p><br>
    <p>But this would be Bernie's night.</p>
